# Covox-Speech-Thing
Covox Speech Thing Clone


This repository is a clone of the Covox Speech Thing designed to fit inside of a DB25 Plastic Hood.  There are two different versions provided.

The first is a mono version.  The second is designed for 'Stereo' jacks.  However, they both emit mono sound.

Design files provided are for Eagle 7.  But should work with other versions of eagle as well.  I have also included gerbers for manufacturing.
